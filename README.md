### Few Important Pointers:
1. after booking the slot the data will be saved in the interview table 
2. if any student or any admin is not registered in the platform interviews cannot be scheduled for them
3. after scheduling the interview email will be sent to both, same as the update and cancel
4. a reminder email will be sent to both 30 minutes before the interview
5. with the cronjob, we will create the recurring sots every day for the same day of the upcoming week
